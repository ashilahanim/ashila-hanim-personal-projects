        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Ashila Hanim, and I am a dedicated web developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly websites. I have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, and I am continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skills. In addition to web development, I enjoy exploring languages, writing, and reading in my free time. Welcome to my personal portfolio website! Not to mention, my other interests include languages, writing and reading. In short, I am a language enthusiast, a writer and an avid reader. </p>
        
        <h2>My Educational Background</h2>
        <p>I recently graduated with a Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology from UiTM Pulau Pinang, with a CGPA of 3.85, where I gained a solid foundation in medical science. However, during my last year of study, I discovered my true passion in information and technology. I made my own researches on how to pivot into this field. At last, I met freeCodeCamp, which is one of a free website that introduces legit web development courses. Slowly I gained confidence in developing websites from doing tutorials and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world projects and right now I continuously learning in this ever-evolving industry.</p>
